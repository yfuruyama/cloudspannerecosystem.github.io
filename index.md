The [cloudspannerecosystem](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem) GitHub
organization hosts a collection of public repositories that are owned-by and
developed-for the Cloud Spanner user community.

All the hosted projects are based on open source community contributions. We'd
love for you to report issues, file feature requests, and send pull requests.
See below for details on [contributions](#contributing). Note that none of the
projects are officially supported by Google as part of the Cloud Spanner
product.

Please [let us know](https://gitter.im/cloudspannerecosystem/community) if
you're interested in getting your project hosted! This will help other Cloud
Spanner developers find your project and contribute to it.

# Projects

### SampleDB

This application allows you to quickly get a sample database into Cloud Spanner.
It does so by loading data from a CSV file into a new Cloud Spanner database.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/sampledb)

### App Engine sample

This sample demonstrates how to use Cloud Spanner from the App Engine Standard
with Java 11 environment.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/appengine-java-sample)

### HarbourBridge

HarbourBridge is a stand-alone tool for Cloud Spanner evaluation, using data
from an existing PostgreSQL database. The tool ingests pg_dump output,
automatically builds a Spanner schema, and creates a new Spanner database
populated with data from pg_dump.

This tool is under active development and will support other source databases in
the future. If you would like to get involved, please check out the following
links:
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/harbourbridge)
* [blog post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/02/harbourbridge-from-postgresql-to-cloud.html)
* [whitepaper](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/harbourbridge/blob/master/whitepaper.md)
* [open issues](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/harbourbridge/issues)

### spanner-cli

spanner-cli is an interactive command line tool, inspired by the `mysql` utility.
It allows you to control your Cloud Spanner databases with idiomatic database
commands, such as `SHOW TABLES` or `SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/spanner-cli)

### spanner-dump

spanner-dump is a command line tool for exporting a Cloud Spanner database in text format.
This tool can be used for Cloud Spanner service for testing purposes or databases running on [Cloud Spanner Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator).
You can import exported databases into Cloud Spanner again with [spanner-cli](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/spanner-cli).

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/spanner-dump)

### wrench

wrench is a schema management tool for Cloud Spanner.
It manages DDLs for schema migration and provides several schema related features
like creating / deleting databases and loading schemas from files.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/wrench)

### yo

yo is a command-line tool to generate database-specific code to access Cloud Spanner through Go objects instead of SQL queries.
It does so by fetching schema metadata for a database by querying the [information schema](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/information-schema) and applies Go templates to generate code / models.

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/yo)
